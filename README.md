An open-source, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

This a drop-in replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing additional useful features. Keep in mind - this does not touch or modify the game client itself, it's just a launcher!

If you encounter a bug, or would like to suggest a feature, please submit an issue!
 
Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* A customizable launcher (including dark theme!)
* Persistent file modifications (re-adds the old death sound!)
* Support for opting in to pre-release testing channels
* Painless Discord Rich Presence support
* Support for silent automatic FPS unlocking with [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker)

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.9-windows-x64-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway.
 
It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can change your preferences if needed.
